Literature Review I


For this literature review, I decided to choose a topic I've been interested in for awhile 
and it even led me to take this class; augmented reality, and in particular, augmented reality for 
intensive engineering workforce training. Since I was a kid, I always wondered how professions like 
aeronautical engineering get hands on training while being remaining budget friendly. Today, 
leading computer graphic scientists have created the best thing to happen for newbie aerospace engineers:
augmented reality training. 

Augmented reality is different than the traditional virtual reality in that it does exactly what it's name 
describes; it augments the physical world with virtual images. My secondary source mentions that augmented reality
can be seen in almost every industry now; from video games like Pokemon Go to furniture shopping. It also segues into
my main article in that, the most ground breaking, revolutionary way that augmented reality is particularly suited for 
the maintenance industry. It mentions that it can take up to 2,000 hours for aviation engineer inspectors
to receive enough training to be considered professionals. Unfortunately, due to the nature of airplanes that
require maintenance (ie they can't really move), mechanics must travel great distances to learn how to fix them.
Fully implemented augmented reality systems would allow engineers to experience the permutations they could come across
in the field and allow them to experiment and learn how to fix the problem before they "need" to fix the problem. 

The article I chose for my primary source focuses on a prototype which had been designed to help instruct new
aeronautical engineers on how to perform maintenance on an airplane. The developers of the prototype decided that starting 
with something simple like changing the oil would the best way to begin this massive undertaking of developing
a system with such drastic technological requirements. The researchers went into depth on what algorithm they decided to
choose for their natural image processing, in which they decided on SURF - an algorithm designed to maximize computational
efficiency. They were able to achieve a FPS of 10, which worked just fine for their prototype. The aerospace engineers gave them
flying reviews on their prototype and encouraged them to keep developing this product because it has potential to become
a quintessential aspect of modern engineering.
